Repository for GUPPY App Challenge 2017

This is a decision maker program to be run on Android phones. It uses a combination of Java, XML and the Android SDK libary with Android Studio. It was quite challenging to make and there are many thanks of course to be had. Anyways, all you have to do is run the program in Android Studio and it will be on your Samsung phone! It might go on the App Store but that is to be answered.
